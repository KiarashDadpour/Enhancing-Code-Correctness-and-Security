# Overview

This repository contains a minimal PHP-based demonstration intended only for defensive security training, tooling evaluation, and secure-coding exercises. It intentionally includes a vulnerable example to be used as a controlled lab for learning how to detect and remediate SQL injection issues — not for offensive misuse.
